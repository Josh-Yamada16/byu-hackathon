Required Texts
Children’s Mathematics (2nd ed.) by Thomas Carpenter, et. al. (ISBN: 978-0-325-05287-8)
Course Description
MTHED 305 is designed to help you develop a deeper understanding of important elementary mathematics concepts, as
well as to help you improve your ability to reason mathematically, communicate mathematical ideas, and solve
mathematics problems. You will engage in mathematical exploration and problem solving related to topics you are likely
to teach in elementary school, and you will communicate your thinking both orally and in writing. Because the
mathematical knowledge you need as a teacher is deeply connected to the practice of teaching children, we will also
examine how children think and learn about these topics. We will also consider how teaching practices can promote
learning with understanding
Grading Scale
Your final grades for the course will be given as follows:
A 94.0% to 100% B 84.0% to 87.9% C 74.0% to 77.9% D 64.0% to 67.9%
A- 91.0% to 93.9% B- 81.0% to 83.9% C- 71.0% to 73.9% D- 61.0% to 63.9%
B+ 88.0% to 90.9% C+ 78.0% to 80.9% D+ 68.0% to 70.9% E below 61%
Graded Components
Exams (60%)
Midterms - Two take-home midterm exams will be administered over the course of the semester. A test revision option
is available to students who earn an A- or lower on either midterm exam; more details will be provided to you after the
first exam.
Final Exam - A cumulative take-home final exam will be available for pick up at 8:00 am on Friday December 12 (the first
day of finals) and due at 8:00 am Monday December 15; more details will be provided towards the end of the semester.
Revisions are not available for the final exam.
Homework and Readings (20%)
Homework is assigned every class period, to be completed before the beginning of the following class, and is scored for
completion only. Throughout the semester we will be reading the book Children’s Mathematics, and there will
occasionally be additional readings posted to Learning suite. The purpose of the readings is to help you think about the
work of teaching mathematics to children in the context of the mathematics we are learning in class. Work related to
readings will include class discussions and periodic assignments, which will be included in your homework grade.
Analyses of Children’s Thinking (15%)
You will have the opportunity to observe elementary age children reasoning about the mathematics we learn about in
class at three points during the semester, including two in-person interviews and a classroom observation. Each
opportunity will involve advance preparation, and written analysis according to principles learned in class.
Professional Activities (5%)\nStudents enrolled in any mathematics education course are required to complete two professional activities related to
teaching mathematics. The Mathematics Education Association (MEA) is BYU’s student association for all students who
expect to teach elementary or secondary mathematics, and is a student-led affiliate of the National Council of Teachers
of Mathematics (NCTM). Most math education classes require attendance at these activities to fulfill the professional
requirement. Other options for fulfilling the requirement can be found on Learning Suite, and I encourage you to fulfill
the professional component in a way that is meaningful to you as a future teacher of elementary mathematics.
To receive credit, you will submit a description of what you did and what you learned for each of the two activities (1-2
paragraphs) on Learning Suite before the end of the semester. This description is required for all professional activities,
including MEA activities.
Class Policies
Cell Phone, Laptop, and Tablet Use: Phones, laptops, tablets, etc. may be used in support of classroom activities (e.g., as
a calculator or reference, or for taking notes). However, other uses are distracting and disruptive to your learning, and to
the students around you. Unless they are being used for class purposes, phones, laptops, tablets, etc. should remain in
your backpack during class time as a courtesy to the instructor and other students, and any necessary cell phone
communication should take place outside the classroom.
Attendance: Attendance is crucial to success in this course, and excessive absences will affect your grade as follows:
• If you miss 4 or more class sessions, you will not be able to earn higher than an A-.
• If you miss 5 or more class sessions, you will not be able to earn higher than a B.
• If you miss 6 or more class sessions, you will not be able to earn higher than a B-.
• If you miss 7 or more class sessions, you will not be able to earn higher than a C.
• If you miss 8 or more class sessions, you will not be able to earn higher than a C-.
• If you miss 9 or more class sessions, you will be required to withdraw from the course or take an E.
Arriving more than 15 minutes late to class or leaving more than 15 minutes early will count as half an absence; missing
more than half of class will count as a full absence. Nevertheless, if you are only able to come for a partial class, it will
still be to your benefit to come to class for as much time as you are able.
Missed Class Sessions: If it is necessary for you to miss a class, please refer to the content section of our course on
Learning Suite. A summary of the class, as well as any handouts, notes, and homework will be posted by the end of the
day. You should first refer to this, and then make arrangements to speak to group members or to me about content you
missed. If you are absent (no matter the reason), you are still expected to complete homework and assignments by the
due date.
Late Assignments: Without exception, late assignments will be accepted for half credit up to one week after the due
date. Late assignments will not be accepted more than one week after the due date. Exams must be turned in on time to
receive credit; exceptions will be made only on a case-by-case basis.
University Policies
Honor Code
In keeping with the principles of the BYU Honor Code, students are expected to be honest in all of their academic work. Academic
honesty means, most fundamentally, that any work you present as your own must in fact be your own work and not that of another.
Violations of this principle may result in a failing grade in the course and additional disciplinary action by the university. Students are
also expected to adhere to the Dress and Grooming Standards. Adherence demonstrates respect for yourself and others and ensures
an effective learning and working environment. It is the university's expectation, and every instructor's expectation in class, that
each student will abide by all Honor Code standards. Please call the Honor Code Office at (801) 422-2847 if you have questions
about those standards.\nPreventing & Responding to Sexual Misconduct
Brigham Young University prohibits all forms of sexual harassment—including sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and
stalking on the basis of sex—by its personnel and students and in all its education programs or activities. University policy requires
all faculty members to promptly report incidents of sexual harassment that come to their attention in any way and encourages
reports by students who experience or become aware of sexual harassment. Incidents should be reported to the Title IX Coordinator
at title9@byu.edu or (801) 422-8692 or 1320 WSC. Reports may also be submitted online at https://titleix.byu.edu/report (24-hours
a day). BYU offers a number of resources and services for those affected by sexual harassment, including the university’s confidential
Sexual Assault Survivor Advocate. Additional information about sexual harassment, the university’s Sexual Harassment Policy,
reporting requirements, and resources can be found in the University Catalog, by visiting http://titleix.byu.edu ,or by contacting the
university’s Title IX Coordinator.
Student Disability
Brigham Young University is committed to providing a working and learning atmosphere that reasonably accommodates qualified
persons with disabilities. A disability is a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities.
Whether an impairment is substantially limiting depends on its nature and severity, its duration or expected duration, and its
permanent or expected permanent or long-term impact. Examples include vision or hearing impairments, physical disabilities,
chronic illnesses, emotional disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety), learning disorders, and attention disorders (e.g., ADHD). If you have
a disability which impairs your ability to complete this course successfully, please contact the University Accessibility Center (UAC),
2170 WSC or 801-422-2767 to request a reasonable accommodation. The UAC can also assess students for learning, attention, and
emotional concerns. If you feel you have been unlawfully discriminated against on the basis of disability, please contact the Equal
Opportunity Office at 801-422-2845, eo_manager@byu.edu, or visit https://hrs.byu.edu/equal-opportunity for help.\nAnticipated Schedule
