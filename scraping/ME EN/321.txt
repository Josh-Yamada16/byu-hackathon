Office hours : Give me a chance to know you
My office hours are right after class! If you are unable to meet during office hours or would like to meet
n
ea different time, feel free to email or drop by my office. If my door is closed, don’t hesitate to knock. If
h
another student is already talking to me, and we’re jabbering away, make your presence known.
W
Office hours are for YOU! This is time that I have set aside each week to dedicate to helping students.
e
sDo not feel like you are taking advantage of my time by coming—that is what the time is for! Don’t feel
o
like you need to stop by exactly at the start time—any time during the entire window is fair game. And
p
rdon’t feel pressured into making it quick, especially if no one else is waiting: if you want to spend the
u
Pwhole block of time hashing out some things or getting help for whatever reason, that’s okay!
s
sMany think that office hours are only for homework help or if you didn’t understand the lecture. That’s
u
cjust the start! You can come into office hours to talk about anything—other things related to the class,
s
iother engineering classes, some fun project idea you’re thinking about, guidance on picking a research
d
olab, talking about graduate programs or career plans, shooting the breeze about baking, etc. This is your
t chance to have dedicated one-on-one time with me, regardless of whether it has to do with
t
athermodynamics. I love it when students come by and you should feel comfortable doing so, for
h
Wwhatever reason.
Office hours are a good way for me to get to know you. If you end up applying to graduate/law/med
s
uschool or jobs that require letters of recommendations, I can’t really write a good one if you were “just”
n
another student in my class. But if you’ve come to office hours and given me a chance to get to know
o
Byou, I can write a better letter for you when it’s needed.
t
n
iSince I just came from China last October, I’m still not very familiar with American students, culture,
o
pand daily life. So, I really hope to learn more about you and also find ways we can help each other.
l aMeeting and talking with you will also help me improve my English, which has gotten a bit rusty over
i
cthe years. I truly appreciate your kindness and support!

Gaining mastery of thermodynamics isn’t easy. Along the way, it can be messy and frustrating and very
demanding. Don’t try to push through alone! TAs can help guide your path through the muck. That’s
why we have them! The TA office is also a fantastic place to find fellow students grappling with the
material. Learn from and teach one another. Effective teamwork is essential for influential engineers.
TA office hours are held in room CB 350. They are posted on Learning Suite under the “Content” tab.

ME EN 321 Course Expectations
• Attend the lectures, ask questions, give answers! When we do mini reviews or practice problems
during lectures, actively work with the people around you. The value of class time increases with the
level of your engagement.
l
u
f • This is a difficult course. To be successful, it will require your consistent and diligent effort. Each
s
s reading assignment will take about ½ hour. Homework problems take a significant amount of time to
e
c be mastered, so avoid procrastination.
c
u • While this material is difficult, it can also be fun! There are incredible ways that thermodynamics
s
affects and enriches our lives. I’m excited to share with you and learn about these things together.
e
b
• As you put forth your honest best effort, I will provide every opportunity I can for you to thrive. If
o
you’re struggling with an assignment, come talk to me. If you have questions about the reading,
t
w come talk to me. If you feel overwhelmed, come talk to me. If you have special circumstances or
o
needs, come talk to me. I want to help you succeed in this course and in your engineering career.
H
• Finally, I expect personal integrity from my students and myself. I encourage group studying and
hope you will collaborate on homework but copying from others or from AI without being
intellectually engaged is cheating. I consider using an online or prior semester’s solution manual
(other than what I post for you on Learning Suite) for Homework Practice or Homework Mastery
problems to be plagiarism. This will be considered a violation of the Honor Code. Cheating isn’t
worth it. Let’s work together to learn the material and we can have a great semester.

Homework
This class has two types of homework. 1. Practice and 2. Mastery.
Practice problems are intended to help you learn the material but not necessarily to assess your
knowledge. To facilitate learning, solutions to Practice problems are posted on Learning Suite. You
should attempt these problems on your own or with other students and check the posted solution as
a last resort for clues or to confirm that you are doing the problems correctly. Please do not to
copy/save the posted Practice solutions. They are only for review as you do the homework.
Mastery problems are intended to assess your ability to apply concepts to new problems. Solutions
to the Mastery problems are not posted prior to the due date. You may confer with other students on
- 4 -\nthese problems and with the TA and the instructor if you have a conceptual question. The TA will
not show you the key or give answers to these problems so please do not request that.
Homework Practice and Mastery problems are due at midnight on the date specified in the syllabus.
Your solutions to homework should be orderly and follow a structured format. Scanned copies of both
Practice and Mastery solutions should be uploaded digitally on Learning Suite. Immediately after the
due date/time, all homework solutions will be posted on Learning Suite. You will have 48 hours to
grade your own homework following the ME EN 321 Homework Self-Grading Procedure below and
to submit a grade under “Homework Report” in Learning Suite. Self-grading helps you learn where you
went wrong while the homework is still fresh in your mind.
ME EN 321 HOMEWORK SELF-GRADING PROCEDURE
Homework solutions will be published on Learning Suite (“Content” tab) immediately after the
homework submission deadline. Students should review the posted solutions and grade their own work.
Each assigned homework problem (Practice and Mastery) should be graded using the following general
grading rubric, with 10 points possible for each problem:
Work Points
Problem setup (Appropriate control volume, process diagram, etc.) 1
Fundamental laws (Correct use of mass, energy, and entropy balances) 4
Property relationships (State postulate, properties correctly determined) 4
Correct numerical answer and units 1
The total score for the assignment should be summed and scaled to 100 points as follows. If N problems
were assigned, the scaled possible score for the assignment would be
(100  sum of scores for all problems) / (10 N)
For example, if 8 problems are assigned and the total self-graded score for the assignment is 71 of a
possible 80, the scaled score would be
(100  71) / 80 = 88.75
Each student will submit this score in the “HW XX Report” in the “Exams” tab on Learning Suite.
Scoring buttons are listed in 5-point increments (e.g., 5, 10, 15, ..., 90, 95, 100). Enter the self-graded
total homework score for the assignment using the buttons, rounded up the nearest 5-point option.
Late Policy
In general, late Homework will not be accepted. However, you are allowed one exception to submit a
late assignment with no penalty. To do so, complete the work when you can and email the scanned copy
of your solutions and self-graded score directly to our TA Brian Easthope (east03@byu.edu).
Late Homework Reports have their own policy. If you email Brian your self-graded score with 24
hours of the deadline, there is a 5-point penalty applied to your score. If the score is emailed to Brian
greater than 24 hours from the deadline, a 15-point penalty will be applied.
Writing Assignment
To practice writing high quality technical reports that you will produce throughout your engineering
career, you will write a technical theory section, results and discussion section for a thermodynamics
problem of your choosing. More details regarding this assignment will be provided later in the semester.
Service Assignment
“I have tried to imagine [Jesus Christ] bustling between meetings or multitasking to get a list of urgent
things accomplished,” President Dieter F. Uchtdorf said. “I can’t see it. Instead, I see the compassionate
and caring Son of God purposefully living each day” (Of Regrets and Resolutions, October 2012 GC).
While each of our semesters will unquestionably be busy, it is important to take time for the most
- 5 -\nimportant things. I will reduce your Homework load this semester to free up time for service. Details of
this assignment will be presented in class.
Education and service in your 20s leads to a happier, more regret-free life in your 30s
Service and BYU’s 150th
Reading Quizzes
There will be a Learning Suite reading quiz on the assigned reading material prior to each class period.
The quizzes are designed to encourage self-learning in the textbook prior to the lecture. Each quiz is
open book and must be taken in Learning Suite by 9:00 am the day it is due. The quiz is found under the
“Exams” tab in Learning Suite titled by the assigned reading section (e.g., “Quiz 1.1-1.11”). A portion
of the total credit for each quiz will be given just for completing the quiz, and the remaining credit will
be given for answering quiz questions correctly. These quizzes cannot be made up. However, the five
lowest scores on quizzes will be dropped. If there is a prolonged illness or other reason for missing more
than five quizzes, I will work out an equitable score with you for missed quizzes.
Exams
There will be three midterm exams and a final exam. The format for each exam will be presented in
class. The final exam will be comprehensive on the date shown in the syllabus.
Grades
The total score for each category is averaged and then weighted by the percentage given below. The
grade scale can be found on Learning Suite. Importantly, note that the grade computed on Learning
Suite throughout the semester is not predictive of your final grade.
Homework & Writing Assignment 18%
Service Assignment 2%
Reading Quizzes 10%
Midterm Exams (3) 45%
Final Exam 25%
Honor Code
In keeping with the principles of the BYU Honor Code, students are expected to be honest in all
academic work. Academic honesty means, most fundamentally, that any work you present as your own
must in fact be your own work and not that of another. Violations of this principle may result in a failing
grade in the course and additional disciplinary action by the university. Students are also expected to
adhere to the Dress and Grooming Standards. Adherence demonstrates respect for yourself and others
and ensures an effective learning and working environment. It is the university's expectation, and every
instructor's expectation in class, that each student will abide by all Honor Code standards. Please call the
Honor Code Office at 801-422-2847 if you have questions about those standards.

Use of AI
Elder Gerrit W. Gong recently taught, “As Church members, we will not grow spiritually if we let
artificial intelligence write our sacrament meeting talks or do our seminary homework. AI cannot
replace our individual effort and spiritual preparation as we prepare lessons, prayers, or blessings.
However, AI may be helpful as we research, edit, translate, or do similar tasks… We are not afraid of
artificial intelligence, nor do we think it is the answer to every problem. As we work hard and smart, AI
can be a valuable tool to enhance but not replace our own efforts… Artificial intelligence cannot replace
revelation or generate truth from God. We have the responsibility to ensure that the Holy Ghost can
- 6 -\nattest to the truth and authenticity of all we say and share—in our form and in our content. As we seek
the Lord’s wisdom and understanding, He will continue to guide and bless us.” (Devotional, 8/19/2025)
You will need to know how to use generative AI software, like ChatGPT, in your engineering career. I
want you to learn to use such tools now, so you’re not disadvantaged at graduation. At the same time, I
want you to learn thermodynamics and how to solve problems. Leaning too much on AI, which can
easily solve many of the problems we look at in this class, will impede your growth as an engineer.
With that in mind, here are a few principles:
1. You may use generative AI to help you prepare for class, study for exams, and brainstorm for
assignments. AI software should not be used to replace course materials such as assigned readings,
nor should it be used for reading quizzes.
2. For homework, you may use generative AI sparingly to help you get unstuck. I discourage it though,
and prefer you look to the textbook, fellow students, TAs, and my office hours first. Growth comes
from overcoming difficult challenges. The work you submit should reflect your intellectual
engagement with and understanding of the material. A copy or cut and paste approach from AI is no
different than copying from another student. Please don’t do it.
3. Generative AI software may not be used for any purpose in any exam situation.

Preventing & Responding to Sexual Misconduct
The health and well-being of students is of paramount importance at Brigham Young University.
If you or someone you know has experienced sexual harassment (including sexual violence),
there are many resources available for assistance.
In accordance with Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, BYU prohibits unlawful sex
discrimination, including sexual harassment, against any participant in its education programs or
activities. The university also prohibits sexual harassment by its personnel and students. Sexual
harassment occurs when
• a person is subjected to unwelcome sexual speech or conduct so severe, pervasive, and offensive
that it effectively denies their ability to access any BYU education program or activity;
• any aid, benefit, or service of BYU is conditioned on a person’s participation in unwelcome
sexual conduct; or
• a person suffers sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, or stalking on the basis of
sex.
University policy requires all faculty members to promptly report incidents of sexual harassment that
come to their attention in any way, including through face-to-face conversations, a written class
assignment or paper, class discussion, email, text, or social media post. Incidents of sexual harassment
should be reported to the Title IX Coordinator at t9coordinator@byu.edu or 801-422-8692 or 1085
WSC. Reports may also be submitted online at https://titleix.byu.edu/report or 1-888-238-1062 (24-
hours a day).
BYU offers confidential resources for those affected by sexual harassment, including the university’s
Sexual Assault Survivor Advocate, as well as a number of non-confidential resources and services that
may be helpful. Additional information about Title IX, the university’s Sexual Harassment Policy,
reporting requirements, and resources can be found at http://titleix.byu.edu or by contacting the
university’s Title IX Coordinator.

Student Disability
- 7 -\nBrigham Young University is committed to providing a working and learning atmosphere that
reasonably accommodates qualified persons with disabilities. A disability is a physical or mental
impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities. Whether an impairment is
substantially limiting depends on its nature and severity, its duration or expected duration, and its
permanent or expected permanent or long-term impact. Examples include vision or hearing impairments,
physical disabilities, chronic illnesses, emotional disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety), learning disorders,
and attention disorders (e.g., ADHD). If you have a disability which impairs your ability to complete
this course successfully, please contact the University Accessibility Center (UAC), 2170 WSC or 801-
422-2767 to request a reasonable accommodation. The UAC can also assess students for learning,
attention, and emotional concerns. If you feel you have been unlawfully discriminated against on the
basis of disability, please contact the Equal Opportunity Office at 801-422-5895, eo_manager@byu.edu,
or visit https://hrs.byu.edu/equal-opportunity for help.”

Devotional Attendance
President C. Shane Reese recently said, "Our BYU devotionals are such an important part of our
uniqueness at BYU. They provide us as students, faculty, and staff an opportunity to blend the sacred
elements of the restored gospel of Jesus Christ with elements of academic disciplines. Devotionals help
each of us to develop our full divine potential, which is central to all that we do at BYU. BYU strives to
emit a unique light for the benefit of the world—a light that will enable BYU to be counted among the
exceptional universities in the world and an essential example for the world. I love that each of you has
made it a priority to participate in our devotional today." (Opening remarks, 5/23/23 Devotional). Your
attendance at each devotional and forum is strongly encouraged. You are welcome to join the faculty
each Tuesday (meet at 10:45 am in the Me En front offices) to walk to the Marriott Center and enjoy the
devotional together.
Why is panda one of the easiest words to spell?

An Apostle’s Message
I have observed a common characteristic among the instructors who have had the greatest influence in
my life. They have helped me to seek learning by faith. They refused to give me easy answers to hard
questions. In fact, they did not give me any answers at all. Rather, they pointed the way and helped me
take the steps to find my own answers. I certainly did not always appreciate this approach, but
experience has enabled me to understand that an answer given by another person usually is not
remembered for very long, if remembered at all. But an answer we discover or obtain through the
exercise of faith, typically, is retained for a lifetime. The most important learnings of life are caught—
not taught.
-Elder David A. Bednar, Seek Learning by Faith, Ensign 9/2007
