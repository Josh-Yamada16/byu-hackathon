The instructor reserves the right to make changes in this schedule and in the course policy, procedures and grading with advanced notice to the
students.\nClass Operations
Reading Assignments: Suggested reading material is given in the table above. We will cover chapters 8-15 and it is
suggested that you skim the text proceeding the lecture on the topic. After the lecture and homework have identified the
content you need to understand, read slowly and carefully areas of the text where you need an improved understanding
and of specific content needed.
Quizzes: There will be approximately 10 - 15 quizzes per semester. Quizzes will be unannounced and may occur at
any time during any class. They will be short, approximately 5 minutes long. Each quiz will be worth 10 points and
will cover material identified in previous lectures. The best way to study for quizzes is to listen carefully in class for
hints on what will be covered in the quiz and then review a few minutes before class. There will be no make up
quizzes. You may drop two quizzes. Do not ask me to make up a quiz unless you have already missed two quizzes.
If you miss more than two quizzes and have good reasons, see me and we will work out something equitable.
Homework: Homework will be due at 11:55pm on the designated date. Turn in two separate digital documents for each
assignment. One is formative and the other summative. The solution for each assignment will be posted right after the
assignment is due. There will be no late homework accepted.
Formative Homework – The intent of this homework is to help you learn. You should attempt the problem first on your
own but if you are stuck or need help you are encouraged to ask a friend, TA, instructor or use an AI tool such as chat
GPT. Comparing your solution with an AI solution or the solution manual is encouraged before the work is turned
in. You should not copy the work of others, but you may use the work of others to assess your work and adjust it before
you turn it in.
Summative Homework: These problems are intended to help you test yourself and your ability to solve problems
independently. You may not use AI tools or the solution manual to guide or assess your work on these problems.
The work you turn in for these problems should represent your ability to solve the problem and not the work of others.
You may ask the TA, the instructor or a classmate for help. When you grade these Summative problems, the rubric will
ask you to validate the independence of your work.
Grading: The solutions to all problems will be posted within 10 minutes of the due date and time. Each student should
then grade their own problems and post their score on learning suite within 24 hrs. The homework rubric and procedure
are outlined in a separate document posted on learning suite.
Late Homework: Late homework will generally not be accepted. One exception for each student will be granted for
those who miss the grading deadline.
Labs: There will be one lab experience during the semester with the intention of improving technical writing. It will be
a walk-in lab experience and will be described in a separated document.
Lab Write - Ups: Student may work in teams of 2 or individually to design their experiment and collect data but each
individual will write a separate lab report.
Exams: You will have three exams and a final. The exams will all be in-class. The final will be given on the date and
time designated by the university. You must be present in person and take the final in the classroom at the
designated time.
Exam grading: I want to correct any grading errors. Submit mis-graded exams to me with a written explanation or a
note pointing out the area you would like to have re-graded. Do not submit exams for re-grade when you are seeking a
one or two point correction because you feel the grading was too severe. Talk to me or a TA whenever you do not
understand an exam problem.
Grading: A final score will be obtained from a weighted average. The weighting for the grades is shown below. The
grade scale will not be increased to make a grade more difficult to obtain but the scale may be lowered if the class GPA
falls below 3.1. I do not use Learning Suite to Calculate the Grade

Self-Grading of homework
Homework will be self-graded by taking a homework quiz and answering the questions on the
homework quiz. The following is a rubric that will represent the scoring the will be present in the
quiz.
For a typical Formative Homework problem worth 10 pts.
1. Demonstrated Attempt Using a Structured Approach: 0 – 4 pts
The written approach contains a structure including given information (Given:), requested
information (Find:) assumptions, diagrams, control volumes, a step-by-step approach, identified
solution and summary comment.
2. Fundamental Concepts Demonstrated: 0 – 4 pts
The written solution uses fundamental concepts correctly and demonstrates a correct understanding
of the concepts.
3. Correct Answer: 0 – 2 pts
The answer is correct. The answer should match the posted solution within reasonable error limits.
Calculation errors, sign errors, incorrect table lookup, unit conversions etc. are examples of these
errors.
For a typical Summative Homework problem worth 10 pts.
1. Demonstrated Attempt Using a Structured Approach 0 – 4 pts
The written approach contains a structured including given information (Given:), requested
information (Find:) assumptions, diagrams, control volumes, a step-by-step approach, identified
solution and summary comment.
2. Fundamental Concepts Demonstrated 0 – 4 pts
The written solution uses fundamental concepts correctly and demonstrates a correct understanding
of the concepts.
3. Correct Answer: 0 – 2
The answer is correct. The answer should match the posted solution within reasonable error limits.
Calculation errors, sign errors, incorrect table lookup, unit conversions etc. are examples of these
errors.
4. Intellectual Integrity - If this answer is false, the score for the homework problem is -10
pts.
True of False – The work represented is my own. I did not use an AI tool, a solution manual, or
copy someone else’s work. I may have conversed with a fellow student or a TA to get ideas. I may
have also asked questions and received answers interacting with a human but after doing so, I
understood what is written and can explain and fully understand the reasoning and work presented. I
may have also read the book or sought answers to conceptual questions on the internet or through
AI, but I did not seek a specific answer to the homework question.\nProblem Solving
Each student can identify issues related to thermodynamics in real world problems, use basic
concepts and fundamental laws to construct thermodynamic models, apply mathematical principles
to solve these models, draw conclusions based on these solutions and formulate sound
recommendations based on these conclusions.
Concepts and Laws of Thermodynamics
Each student can select a system, identify the heat, work, exergy and mass flow interactions
occurring between the system and its surroundings and build models of steady-flow devices and
transient thermodynamic systems.
Thermodynamic Property Relationships
Each student can use thermodynamic concepts and laws to develop relationships between
observable thermodynamic properties and thermodynamic properties that cannot be directly
measured.
Gas Power Cycles
Each student can use the basic concepts and fundamental laws of thermodynamics to model the
performance of various gas power cycles. Each student can evaluate the impact of modifications
such as reheat, regeneration and intercooling on the efficiency and net power produced by a gas
power cycle and draw conclusions regarding the implementation of these modifications.
