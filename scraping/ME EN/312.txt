Course Meeting Structure: This course is an “in-person” course. Students are expected to be in attendance. Student
success is strongly correlated with regular class attendance. Students who feel sick (fever; cough; shortness of
breath/difficulty breathing; chills; muscle pain; sore throat; new loss of taste or smell; etc.) should not attend class
and should work with the instructor to develop a study plan for the duration of the illness.
Office Hours: The course TAs and Instructor will hold in-person office hours where you can ask questions. If
preceded by reasonable personal effort, requests for help on all homework problems will always be cordially
received by both the professor and the course TA.
Prerequisites: ME EN 312 must be preceded by ME EN 321, ME EN 335, and Math 334. Any exceptions must be approved
by the instructor.
Text: 1. Munson, Young, and Okiishi’s Fundamentals of Fluid Mechanics, 9th edition, by Gerhart, Gerhart, and Hochstein,
2021. Use of either the 7th or 8th editions of the text is also acceptable. You may choose to use an electronic version of the
text. Note that any hard or electronic copies of the text that are used should be legal versions that have been paid for.
2. ME EN 312 Course Packet, by D. Maynes. This packet is available at the Bookstore at the cost of printing. It is also
located on Learning Suite. The packet should be brought to each class session since it includes several examples that we will
work together.
Overview: The study of fluid mechanics is exciting and insightful into the phenomena that exist in the world around us. It is
also a subject that is rigorous and mathematical intensive. Thus, we will utilize the multivariable calculus, differential
equations, and linear algebra you have already learned. Our approach will involve class discussions, text readings, working
problems, special projects, and hands-on laboratory experiences. What you learn from this course will depend on your
attitude and commitment to becoming an independent learner and your willingness to work with others. Recall that for each
hour you spend in class, the expectation is that the average student will need to spend two hours outside of class on that
subject. More time will be required to achieve excellence in a particular subject.
Objectives: The objective of this course is to provide an understanding and ability to mathematically model fluid dynamics
phenomena. Specifically, the course content is broken into the 10 core topics listed below. For each topic there are certain
competencies that you should be able to perform upon completion of the course. These are also listed under the
corresponding topic.
Topics: Competencies (What you should be able to do upon completion of 312):
1. Fluid Properties
Understand viscosity as a fluid property and be able to compute shear stress involving Newtonian
fluids. Understand the phenomena of surface tension and cavitation.
2. Pressure in Fluids
Understand variation in pressure in a static gas or liquid, and be able to compute hydrostatic forces and
moments.
3. Flowing Fluids\nBe able to evaluate the local, convective, and total acceleration and understand pressure distributions
normal to and parallel to streamlines. Be able to appropriately apply Bernoulli's principle and
recognize the limitations of it.
4. Conservation of Mass
Be able to apply the integral form of the conservation of mass for steady and unsteady flow situations
with uniform or two-dimensional velocity distributions. Recognize and be able to utilize the
differential form of conservation of mass.
5. Global Force/Momentum Balances
Be able to apply the integral form of the linear momentum principle and apply global force/momentum
balances for stationary and constant velocity frames of reference with uniform or two-dimensional
velocity distributions. Recognize the Navier-Stokes equations and solve them for simplified viscous
flows.
6. Dimensional Analysis
Be able to determine appropriate dimensionless variables for a given dynamical situation and predict
prototype behavior based on similitude, and understand the pitfalls of modelling.
7. Mechanical Energy Equation
Understand the mechanical energy equation and be able to apply it to laminar and turbulent flow with
minor and major losses through pipe networks.
8. Velocity Distributions, Form Drag and Flow Separation
Be able to model velocity distributions in flat plate boundary layers in laminar and turbulent flows and
to predict skin friction drag. Understand the phenomena of flow separation and its impact on the total
drag.
9. Real World Problem Solving
Be able to utilize the principles of fluid dynamics to analyze and solve real world flow phenomena. Be
able to use structured techniques (e.g. The 5 Ps of problem definition) to develop an engineering
problem statement based on real-world applications of fluid mechanics and apply structured problem-
solving techniques (e.g. SAFER) to solve fluids engineering problems.
10. Investigate Phenomena and Communicate Results
Be able to present results of fluid dynamic phenomena graphically in terms of appropriate
dimensionless variables and effectively communicate results.
Email/BYU Learning Suite: I will use email and the BYU Learning Suite to relay information relating to the class. Check
your email and Learning Suite messages regularly. All assignments will be posted on the BYU Learning Suite with the due
date specified.
Homework: Homework will be due weekly on Wednesday by 11:59 p.m. and should be submitted electronically to
Learning Suite. Homework assigned from the Munson text can be found on Learning Suite under the “Content” tab.
Note that some assigned problems have a “R” number (i.e. 5.1.3R). These problems are not found in some versions
of the printed textbook, but are located on LS with the uploaded Munson problem sets. The purpose of the
homework is to solidify the principles discussed in class and the text so that mastery of the topic can be achieved.
Some of the homework problems will be considered practice problems (answers will be available) and each week
there will be a few mastery problems assigned. All homework will be turned in electronically through Learning
Suite. Solutions to the practice problems should be prepared using an abbreviated SAFER method you learned in
ME EN 101 on paper of your choice. Working with others on practice problems is encouraged as long as all
contribute equally, copying another person’s work (or online solutions) is not acceptable. Students will complete an
assessment on Learning Suite for each set of practice problems. Homework mastery problems should be completed
without discussion with other members of the class. Communicating solutions to real-world engineering problems is
a critical skill and is foundational to becoming an influential engineer. Thus, a significant portion of your score on
homework mastery problems will be based on the professional nature of your solution. Solutions to all homework
mastery problems should be prepared using the complete SAFER method and the problem-solving template
available for purchase from the bookstore (shelved under author “Mechanical Engineering Department”), or
downloaded from the course Learning Suite site. All mastery problems will be graded and returned. If preceded by
reasonable personal effort, requests for help on all homework problems will always be cordially received by both the
professor and the course TA. Late homework will be accepted only until 5:00 p.m. the day (Thursday) after the
homework is due with a penalty of 15%.
Reading: It is not possible to cover all relevant material in class, thus reading of the assigned material is expected before class
time. This will not only increase your exposure to the subject, but it will also prompt questions and class discussion on items
needing clarification. The reading you should read prior to each lecture period is shown on Learning Suite.\nLectures: Just as we cannot cover in class all of the information in the text, we will cover in class much information that is
not found in text. Thus, it is most prudent to be an active participant in class in addition to being well-versed in the text. The
topic for each lecture is shown on the schedule posted on Learning Suite.
Labs and Special Problems: There will generally be one real-world problem, do-at-home experiment, laboratory exercise or
other special problem assigned each week. The due date and deliverables for each will be specified when they are assigned.
Quizzes: Approximately 10-12 quizzes will be given in-class during the semester; generally there will be at least one
quiz/week. The quizzes will generally consist of conceptual questions derived from the text, lecture, homework assignments,
viewed videos, and laboratory. The time requirement for each quiz will be typically about 5 minutes and the lowest two quiz
scores will be dropped before the final grade is determined. When quizzes are returned, they can be picked up in the “Return
Work” box located in the south hallway on the 3rd floor of the EB. When completing the quiz, do not write your name on the
quiz, instead each student will put their chosen 4-digit identifier on the exam. To choose your 4-digit identifier, complete the
extra-credit quiz assignment that is due on Friday September 5th.
Exams: Two mid-term exams are scheduled in addition to a comprehensive final exam. All midterms will be administered in
the Testing Center and will have a time limit of 90 minutes. The format of all exams will be closed book and closed note. An
equation sheet will be provided in addition to any relevant information that is needed.
Citizenship: As a student at BYU you are expected to adhere to the honor code. Academic dishonesty in any form will be
justification for a failing grade in the class and has no place in the engineering profession. Class attendance and participation
by asking and responding to questions is expected. Specific examples of good citizenship are: 1) asking well thought
questions, 2) respectful response to questions, 3) respectfully addressing fellow classmates, the TA, and the Professor, 4)
assisting others with difficult concepts, etc. Specific examples of bad citizenship include but are not limited to: 1) talking or
texting with others during lecture, 2) arriving late to class, 3) cell phone interruption of class, etc. A citizenship record will
be kept throughout the semester by the instructor.
Grading Procedures:
Homework Practice Problems 60
Homework Mastery Problems 60
Quizzes 100
Special Problems/Laboratories 60
Two Mid-Term Exams (100 pts. each) 200
Comprehensive Final Exam 150
Total 630 pts
If performance on the final exam is greater than the lowest midterm or composite quiz score, the final score will replace this
score. If everyone scores in the 90-100 range I will award everyone A’s. However, I reserve the right to curve the grades if
the class average lies below 80%.
Extra Credit: A few opportunities for extra credit will be given throughout the semester.
Honor Code Standards: In keeping with the principles of the BYU Honor Code, students are expected to be honest
in all of their academic work. Academic honesty means, most fundamentally, that any work you present as your
own must in fact be your own work and not that of another. Violations of this principle may result in a failing grade
in the course and additional disciplinary action by the university. Students are also expected to adhere to the Dress
and Grooming Standards. Adherence demonstrates respect for yourself and others and ensures an effective learning
and working environment. It is the university’s expectation, and my own expectation in class, that each student will
abide by all Honor Code standards. Please call the Honor Code Office at 422-2847 if you have questions about
those standards.
Preventing Sexual Discrimination or Harassment: Sexual discrimination or harassment (including student-to-
student harassment) is prohibited both by the law and by Brigham Young University policy. If you feel you are
being subjected to sexual discrimination or harassment, please bring your concerns to the professor. Alternatively,
you may lodge a complaint with the Equal Employment Office (D-240C ASB) or with the Honor Code Office.\nStudents with Disabilities: If you have a disability that may affect your performance in this course, you should get in
touch with the office of Services for Students with Disabilities (1520 WSC). This office can evaluate your disability
and assist the professor in arranging for reasonable accommodations.
Aims of a BYU Education: The mission of Brigham Young University is "to assist individuals in their quest for
perfection and eternal life" (hereafter Mission Statement). To this end, BYU seeks to develop students of faith,
intellect, and character who have the skills and the desire to continue learning and to serve others throughout their
lives.
Mechanical Engineering Department’s BIG: “To be recognized as the best undergraduate mechanical engineering
program in the world and the alma mater for the world’s most influential engineers.”
Influential Engineers Develop:
CHARACTER: Influential engineers have integrity and strong desires to serve their community and their profession.
They do the right thing, even when no one is watching or when others oppose it. Their influence is derived from
strong moral principles and mutual respect. Their sphere of influence expands as others recognize and trust their
character.
RESILIENCE: Influential engineers are resilient and learn from their failures. They persevere in pursuit of long-
term goals. They embrace challenge and recognize effort is the path to mastery.
TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE: Influential engineers are innovative experts in their field. They solve significant,
real-world problems by building models based on basic concepts and fundamental laws. They use state-of-the-art
engineering practices and technologies to solve their models and obtain results.
COMMUNICATION SKILLS: Influential engineers communicate results and conclusions clearly and concisely.
They persuasively present recommendations that prevent and solve problems. They are collaborative and always
civil, particularly when others have differing viewpoints.
LEADERSHIP: Influential engineers lead in ethical behavior regardless of their position. They focus more on the
greater good than on personal achievement. They make tough decisions when necessary. They inspire with genuine
praise, correct with kindness when necessary and generously recognize the contributions and accomplishments of
colleagues.
LIFELONG LEARNING AND SERVICE: Influential engineers consistently develop new skills and use their
abilities and resources to enhance the lives of others.
“Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful
men of talent. Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will not; the world is full of
educated derelicts. Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent.” – President Calvin Coolidge
“And as all have not faith, seek ye diligently and teach one another words of wisdom; yea, seek ye out of the best
books words of wisdom; seek learning, even by study and also by faith.” - D&C 88:118\nHomework, Labs, Special Problems/Videos

Special Problems/Laboratories
Working in a group of not more than three individuals conduct an experiment to determine the
time required for a 2-L pop bottle to drain when oriented in the normal vertical position. The bottle
should drain through a small hole that you will drill into the bottle (put the hole near the bottom of the
bottle but still in the constant diameter portion of the bottle). Measure the time to drain from some initial
known volume to a final volume (where the only remaining fluid is just above the level of the drain
hole). Repeat your experiment with the same initial volume 2-3 times to minimize your uncertainty and
conduct the experiment for at least three different initial volumes (i.e. full, 2/3 full, and 1/3 full). Also
perform a control volume analysis to predict the drain time utilizing the conservation of mass and
Bernoulli’s principles we have learned in class. To do this you will need to make very careful
measurements of all relevant variables (i.e. drain hole diameter, bottle inside diameter, total volume
drained, initial and final water levels above the drain hole, etc.). Further, you will recall from your
previous experiments with this 2-liter bottle that to obtain the correct mass flow rate from the bottle you
need to use a contraction coefficient. For a thin-wall orifice and free-jet, the contraction coefficient is
known to be 0.61. Compare your experimental results with the prediction graphically and comment on
the discrepancy, if any.\nAssignment #6 (Oct 15) (Reduced set this week – Exam 1 10/14-10/16)
