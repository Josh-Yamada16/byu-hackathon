  "courseDescription": "The subject of this course is aircraft and rocket design. Students learn basics of aerodynamics, structures, stability, propulsion, and performance as applied to flight vehicle design. Introduces fundamentals of aerospace engineering with focus on understanding tradeoffs amongst multiple disciplines to enable vehicle-level design. Course involves combination of theory, analytic methods, computational tools, and hands-on design project.",
  "courseApproach": "Rather than deep dive into any one discipline, focus is on understanding tradeoffs amongst multiple disciplines",
